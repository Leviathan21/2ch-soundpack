# 2ch-soundpack
A soundpack compiled by 2ch anonymous for his own usage, published for everyone to use freely. While being rather outdated (made in fucking 2018) its the most compiled and fitting into the game in my humble opinion, having also filled in the mods and full blown ost (downloaded separately because i dont want copyright hitmen at my doorstep). Cause the soundpack is rather aged, report missing or unnatural sounds like shotguns firing out a .50 bmg gunshot or elements lacking sound outright freely as i am to refit this shit to modern standards.
